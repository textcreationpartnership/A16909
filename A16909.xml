         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Beſides verie manie moe, that in euerie one of theſe ages I haue omitted. In ſo much, that ſkarce any piece or article there is of our whole Faith, but by one or other, firſt or laſt, it hath bin called in queſtion. And that with ſuch likeing for the time, that they haue all in a manner drawen after them great heardes of followers, and brought many others alſo to doubt and wauer.</p>
            <p>I ſay not here, which ſort did well,
<pb facs="tcp:7013:5"/> nor which did ill. But gone they all are, &amp; haue receiued, as they deſerued, both they that with the ſeuerall blaſtes would not be moued, and they that remoued. And now are wee vppon the ſtage, our courſe alſo very nere at ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to be called of, and to giue accompt how we played our partes: yea euery day and houre ſome of vs ſerued with ſuch citations. And no ſooner any man appeareth, but by and by he heareth his iudgement, full grieuous (God knoweth) and importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if ſuch were his deſertes. Then to repent, too late: and to ſeek our wonted ſolace of wordly things, in vaine. No man then, that can make himſelfe a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine to leane vpon to eaſe hys elbowes. Neither vaine glorie, that then can ſerue the turne, nor braue apparaile, nor great liuings, nor carnall pleaſure, nor ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous buildings, nor ſucceſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in lands or ſtates: finallie, no other earthly thing, that any foole here imagineth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, &amp; for the tranſitory ſhadow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of letteth goe his handfaſt of eternitie.</p>
            <p>Which well and deepely conſidered are not they now happie who in thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:7013:6"/> former like perilous times did know the right way, and for to winne nothing, nor to leeſe nothing, would forſake it? And they againe now moſt miſerable wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that for ſuch ſhadowes, contemned the right, or embraced the wrong? We then alſo at this preſent ſtanding in like perill, and euerlaſting daunger of our ſoules, haue we not neede to awake, to ſhake off our ſlouth, and to looke about vs? I deale not now with them, which ſay in their fooliſh heartes, that there is no God, no Chriſt, no ſoule, no heauen, no hell, no right way, nor no wrong: of whome (God help) the world is too too full. Neither with them do I deale, which thinke no way at all ſo wrong, but that it may ſerue well enough to heauen. All which ſorts of vaine men, how vviſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer that they ſeeme in their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, haue moſt certainely all good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, all true wiſedome, and (which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chriſtian men is moſt irrefraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) all Diuine Scripture, cleane againſt them, For whereſoeuer the ſaid Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſpeake of Nicolaites and ſuch like, who is there, that findeth left for ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:7013:6"/> any hope of ſaluation?</p>
            <p>Therefore to leaue theſe, vaniſhing away in their fooliſh fanſies, and to talke with others that beleeue the Scriptures, and therefore thinke well that ſome in thoſe forſaid ages found the way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, &amp; that other ſome by walking by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies are fallen into damnation: of theſe I demaund (if at leaſt wiſe they care for themſelues, more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for their pelfe that ſoone will forſake them) whether they would not be glad to know theſe waies, to walke the one, and to auoid the other? the matter is paſt with thoſe aforetime: it is we that are in daunger, that ſtand of making, or els of marring. If happely we could light in the ſteppes of them that are in Heauen, wee were made foreuer. But if we walke on the ſame pathes that lead others to hel, then are wee marred and vndonne foreuer.</p>
            <p>Here therefore it would be known, what way they that now are ſafe, did then take when they were in perill. In their ſeuerall times very many and verie great queſtions (as I haue ſaid) vvere mooued by new deuiſers: and ſome all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
<pb facs="tcp:7013:7"/> there vvere, that could, and did trie the matters with them by learning: but theſe very few, if we compare them with the multitude, beſides that the ſaid triall is very long: and many, before it can be made, paſſe out of this world, to their certaine damnation, if they go vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine. What other remedy, what bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way is there than for ſuch? Is there any, or is there none?

            <p>Here (as wee ſee) this moſt learned, moſt holy, moſt renoumed Father alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth many moſt worthy reaſons (as hee tearmeth them) to hold him ſtill a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike. As indeed vpon that matter he wrote his whole ſaid booke <hi>De vtilitate credendi,</hi> Concerning the vtility of bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.

And alſo Vincentius Lyrinenſis, his booke <hi>Contra prophanas omnium haereſeon nouationes.</hi> Againſt the prophane inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations of al Hereſies. Theſe their books they wrote of the moſt iuſt and worthy reaſons, which there are to mooue anie man to forſake al Hereſies, and to liue &amp; die a catholike<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which bookes I wiſh all ſuch my deare Countrimen to read, as will know the truth, and ſpecially the holy Scripture of the actes of the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, with Saint Beedes Eccleſiaſtical Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie of our own Nation.</p>

            <p>What ſuch reaſons may to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe be gathered out of thoſe Authors, and their like, grounded all vpon moſt certaine and diuine authoritie, I in this Treatiſe haue in part declared: ſhewing particularly, in euery one of them, ſome vndoubted cauſe to moue any man to beleeue vs, and not the Proteſtants, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritants, nor other Heretikes: &amp; in all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that nothing there is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of a Chriſtian man, but vvith vs it maketh plainely, and againſt them plainely: no ſuch thing againſt vs, no ſuch thing with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. What thoſe things are, <hi>S. Augustine</hi> a litle before did partly vtter: and by reading ouer this Treatiſe thou ſhalt more fullie know. Which whoſoeuer will vouchſafe to doe vvith any crumme of the feare of God, I mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile much, but hee will confeſſe in his mouth or heart, that the truth of Chriſt is on our ſide. So plainely ſhall he here perceaue, that our religion it is, vvhich was deliuered to the world by Chriſt our Lord and his Apoſtles, vvhich alſo euer ſince hath ſtill continued, &amp; which is alſo moſt ſure hereafter to continue

For well I wote, that ſome there are, which haue not, nor cannot come by the ſaid books: ſome, that lacke leyſure to peruſe them: ſome, that thinke it ouer tedious to read ſo many, or any one of them: ſome that thinke many of them, either for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or for the handling, too hard for them: and yet theſe either deſirous, or at leaſt, content to learne, if they might ſee a readier, ſhorter, and eaſier way thereto.</p>
            <p>For ſuch therefore I will, by the help of God, in this briefe Treatiſe, open and ſhew very many ſuch waies, moſt ſure, moſt plaine, and withall moſt ſhort: that whoſoeuer would ſoone diſpatch, ſhall in any one of them finde his deſire: and yet who ſo that will walke them all ouer, ſhall not finde it long. Yea, and this I adde moreouer, that wheras by the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:7013:15"/> of a whole booke of the other ſort aboue-named, hee ſhall learne but one truth, or not many moe then one: nor by reading them al, learne but only cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine truthes: as of the B. Sacrament, of Purgatorie, of Confeſsion, of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie, and ſuch like: and ſo hauing learned them, may remaine notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding doubtful in others: he ſhall by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this treatiſe, yea or any part almoſt thereof, learne all truth, and that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that is this day in queſtion, but alſo that eyther hath bin, or may be in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion betweene the Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>I ſpeake not this vpon confidence of myne owne wit, or in commendation of my ſelfe, God is witnes: But the truth is, that the preiudicies and euidences for the Catholike faith againſt all Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, are innumerable, and inſuperable: and my chaunce it hath beene, through the mercifull prouidence and goodneſſe of God to liue certaine yeares in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie with Catholike men of great ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, wiſedome, &amp; knowledge, bleſſed of God moſt liberally with his graces, ſuch as our miſerable Countrie is not worthy
<pb facs="tcp:7013:15"/> of: whoſe daily familiar talke of ſuch thinges I haue vſed to heare, as to my great admiration: ſo likewiſe with all diligence and attention.</p>
            <p>And what I haue through ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication at ſundrie times, or of my ſelfe at other times, by meanes thereof obſerued: I purpoſe, as memorie ſhall ſerue me, &amp; God aſsiſt me, being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto both iuſtly mooued, and earneſtly required, in this booke at once to vtter it in part, rather for a little taſte, then for a full &amp; iuſt diſcourſe, and that onely to Gods glorie, lightning of mine owne ſinfull burden, and ſoule-health of my deare Countrimen, knowing both their exceeding great need of ſuch helps, and alſo the vndoubted and preſent vertue of the remedies to ſuch as will receaue them.</p>
            <p>And therfore wheras againe there be many, which for worldly feare, or reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe negligence, or proud diſdaine, will not read bookes: vpon whom yet good may be done in talke and conference by Catholike charitable men that haue, or may haue acceſſe vnto them, knowing
<pb facs="tcp:7013:16"/> meanes and wayes of perſwaſion: this Treatiſe vnto ſuch Catholikes may be a Manual or Enchiridion, readie alwaies at hand to miniſter vnto them (for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading of ſuch their friends) choiſe of inuention. Wherein I beſeech all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes for the loue and mercie of God to be earneſt and diligent, knowing, that as Saint Iames ſaith, <hi>He that cauſeth a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to turne from his errour into the way of truth ſhall ſaue his ſoule from death, and couer a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of ſinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wel then in the name of God to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme theſe premiſſes: this firſt is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine &amp; generally confeſſed, that, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as al which profeſſe the name of Chriſt, be (in reſpect of their beleefe) either ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes or Heretikes: for finding of the truth of Chriſt, as our Sauiour ſaid then to the Samaritan woman, <hi>Salus ex Iudaeis eſt,</hi> Saluation is of the Iewes, and not of the Samaritans: ſo now Catholikes muſt be ſought vnto, and Heretikes, as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptors of the ſame truth, muſt be auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. For vnto this purpoſe ſaith Saint Paule to Titus his Diſciple and Biſhop of Crete: <hi>Aman that is an Heretike after one
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7013:16"/> or two admonitions, doe thou auoide: knowing, that ſuch a one is ſubuerted and ſinneth, being by himſelfe condemned:</hi> euen ſo as ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactours in priſon, hang themſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Aſsiſe, being ſo their own iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and not abiding for the ſentence of the ordinary Iudge that cometh in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuite. For ſo Heretikes caſt them-ſelues by running out of the Churches vnitie of their owne accord, whereas murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, aduouterers, theeues, and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers abide within, vntill by excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication they be throwen out. And to the ſame purpoſe in an other place hee rekoneth vp <hi>Hereſies</hi> amongſt <hi>the works of the fleſh,</hi> togeather with <hi>fornication, aduou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, idolatrie, ſorcerie, murder, and ſuch like:</hi> ſaying of them all in generall, that <hi>who ſo doe ſuch things, ſhall not inherit the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God.</hi> But on the other ſide, the Catholike Church wee doe all in the Creede of the Apoſtles profeſſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, ſaying as the ſayed Apoſtles haue taught vs: <hi>I beleeue the Catholike Church.</hi> And the ſame with more wordes, in the Crede of S. <hi>Athanaſius: Whoſoeuer hath a will to be ſaued before all things it is requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite,
<pb facs="tcp:7013:17"/> that he hold the Catholike faith: which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe a man keepe whole &amp; ſound, without doubt for euer ſhall he periſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This profeſsion make not we only but our aduerſaries alſo with vs, publikely &amp; ſolemnely in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregations. So that it is, as I haue ſaid, ſure in it ſelfe, and alſo of vs both confeſſed, that as with the Catholikes is truth and ſaluation, ſo with the Heretikes are errours and damnation. If therefore I proue that we be Catholikes, and they Heretikes: it will follow therevpon neceſſarily, that we haue the truth, and the whole truth, and nothing but the truth: and that they are farre from the truth, and without, &amp; againſt the truth: wee therefore to be beleeued and folowed, they to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken and deteſted. This then with Gods helpe will I moſt plainly ſhew di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe and ſundrie waies: and euery one way by himſelfe ſo euident, ſo ſure, ſo vndoubted, as the walker therein ſhall ſee, that there is no feare of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leading.</p>

               <p>Wel, but we are called Papiſtes, they will ſay, for doctrine. To that I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere: wee doe not ſo call our ſelues, neither be wee ſo called in the world abrode, but Catholikes euerie where, as in <hi>Italie, Spaine, Fraunce, &amp;c.</hi> VVhich they that trauaile, can beare me witneſſe but it is a name put vppon vs by the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes: as their vſe hath alwaies binne to doe, to tearme the Catholikes by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine odious names So did the Arrians tearme vs Homouſians &amp; others other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. For, that theſe be not our names, it is moſt euident by this, that wee were manie hundred yeares, as they know themſelues and confeſſe, before thoſe names were inuented: and all that time were wee not without a name. Let them name their eldeſt author or witnes of that name, and if I proue not, that vvee were then aboue a thouſand yeare old: let Papiſtes be our name. I ſay therefore
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7013:24"/> with <hi>Saint Auguſtine: Quod quaerentibus ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis eſt, vna eſt Catholica, cui haereſes aliae diuerſa nomina imponunt, cum ipſae ſingulae proprijs vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabulis, quae negare non audeant, appellentur.</hi> There is one Church Catholike, vppon the which diuerſe Hereſies put diuerſe names, whereas they, euerie one, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues are called by propre and ſpeciall names which they dare not to denie. And this is ſufficient for ſuch as ſeeke of whom to learne the truth.</p>
               <p>If laſt of all they ſay, that yet by our owne Confeſsion we are called Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes which is an other name then Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and therefore in danger of Saint <hi>Hieromes</hi> ſentence aboue pronounced: they trouble me ſore, I graunt, and put me to my ſhiftes to anſwere it well. But they doe withall, ye wot, as a man that would refuſe to be ſticked by mee with my ſword, and would runne vppon my ſpeare. For you know pardie, by my firſt note, that the name of Catholikes ſerueth well my turne, quite to diſpatch them, what ſoeuer exception they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend thereby to make againſt this third note. For, that it is no good exception,
<pb facs="tcp:7013:25"/> you may hereby perceaue, becauſe the Fathers make both notes, as I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. Wherefore the one deſtroyeth not the other, but they ſtand both well together. The cauſe thereof is this, for that chriſtians and catholikes are both but one name, and ſo of the Fathers v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and accompted: who therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly deny Heretikes to be Chriſtians, becauſe they are not Catholikes, that is to ſay, Chriſtians of all Chriſtendome, but only of ſome peece. The difference only is, that the name Catholike is plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in this caſe, and inuented to be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as a very ſingular <hi>Epitheton,</hi> vvith <hi>Christians,</hi> ſo to put all out of doubt, in ſaying <hi>Catholike Chriſtians.</hi> For if they were not all one, a man might as vvell ſay, <hi>Heretike Chriſtians,</hi> which no man v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to ſay.

               <pb facs="tcp:7013:26"/>
               <p>Well then: Hereſie it was aforetime to deny, as theſe men doe, that praier or offering may be made for the dead. And that we plainly ſhew out of all Recordes of Hereſies, left vnto vs by the writing of moſt approued Notaries. For the Greeke Church let <hi>Saint Epiphanius</hi>

                  </note> I will recite out of our owne Countrie-man <hi>Saint Bede,</hi> which chaunced in his time, in our owne Countrey, no leſſe certaine, then merueilous. A notable thing (hee ſaith) is<note n="*" place="margin">Conſtat</note> certainly knowen to haue bin done in the battaile, wherein was killed King <hi>Elbuine:</hi> vvhich I in no wiſe thinke ſhould be leaſt vntold, but that it wilbe profitable to the ſaluation of manie to rehearſe it.</p>
               <p>In that battayle was ſlaine amongſt others of <hi>Elbuines</hi> ſouldiers, a young man named <hi>Imma,</hi> who hauing that day and the night following amongeſt the bodies of the ſlayne, lyen as dead, at length receauing breath againe, reuiued and ſitting vpp, bounde hys woundes himſelfe as well as he could. Then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting awhile, gat him vpp, and began ſo to goe his waie, where hee might finde frindes to ſee vnto him. In ſo doyng found hee was and taken by him of hys enimies hoaſt, &amp; brought to their Lorde an Earle of King <hi>Edilredes,</hi> of vvhom being asked what he was, hee feared to
<pb facs="tcp:7013:30"/> confeſſe that he was a ſouldier: and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anſwered, that he was a poore man of the countrie, and one that had a wife, ſaying that hee came with others ſuch as he was into the Campe to bring victuals to the Souldiers. But the Lord for all this took him to him, bidding his wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds to be ſeene vnto: and vvhen hee waxed whole, in the night for running awaie he commaunded him to be bound: but yet bound he could not be, for ſtraight, as they were gone that had bound him, the ſame his bonds were looſed: for hee had a brother, whoſe name was <hi>Tunna,</hi> a Prieſt and Abbot of a Monaſterie in the Cittie, which vnto this daie of his name is called <hi>Tunnacester.</hi> Who hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to be killed in the fight, came to ſeeke, if perhaps hee might finde his body, and finding another in all pointes very like vnto him, thought it had bin he, and brought the ſame vnto his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterie, buried him honorably, and for the looſing of his ſoule was diligent of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to ſay Maſſe. By the ſaying whereof vvas done the thing that I haue tolde, that none could bind him but ſtraight he
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7013:30"/> was looſed. In the meane time, the Earle that kept him, began to meruaile, asking how it was that hee could not be boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: whether perhappes hee had about him looſing letters, ſuch as fables ſpeake of, for which he might not be bounden. But he anſwered, that hee knew nothing of ſuch ſorceries: But a brother I haue (ſaid he) a Prieſt, in my country, &amp; ſure I am, that he thinking me to be ſlaine, ſaieth often Maſſe for me. And if I were now in the other life, there ſhould my ſoule by his interceſsions be looſed from paines. After this when he was through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recouered, the Earle ſolde him for London to a certaine Friſian: but ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of him, nor in the way thither could he by any meanes be bounden, but ſtill his enimies laying on him ſundrie kinds of bondes, ſtill vvere they looſed.

And other thinges alſo, vvhich to him in daunger had happened profitably, &amp; proſperouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hee vnderſtood, that by his brothers interceſsion and offering of the Sauing Hoſte they had from heauen bin giuen him. And manie hearing theſe things of the foreſaid man, were in faith and godly deuotion enflamed to pray, or to giue almes, or to offer to our Lord, <hi>Victimas ſacrae oblationis, pro ereptione ſuorum, qui de ſae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culo migrauerunt,</hi> Hoſtes of the Sacred ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the deliuerie of their friendes that were departed this world.

               <p>And therefore, as in the laſt Chapter, I vvilled Miracles to be conſidered, and not iugglinges, or thinges that may be done by reaſon: ſo here I propoſe not illuſions, but Viſions to be conſidered.

               </p>
               <p>I omitte for deſire of breuitie, vvhat many of the auncient Fathers haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of certaine holy women, which in time of perſecution being ſought for to be abuſed, killed themſelues: conſtantly and vniformely holding them for Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, becauſe of the Churches practiſe in moſt ſolemne honouring of them: and thinking rather, that the Church did know, the ſaid women to haue had ſome plaine reuelation from God ſo to doe, then that ſhe erred in her practiſe. But and if any man here be ſo foliſh to ſay, or to thinke, or to feare, that now the caſe is altered, becauſe wee liue ſo long after the ſaying of thoſe wordes by <hi>Saint Paul,</hi> and S. <hi>Augustine:</hi> let him conſider firſt,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7013:62"/> that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> alſo liued almoſt foure hundred yeares after S. <hi>Paule,</hi> and yet ſo thought he not the caſe then to be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that hee vttered the matter vvith more weight of wordes by a great deale, as you ſee.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that if it were a caſe, which by any ſpace of time might be altered, then had both Saint <hi>Paules,</hi> &amp; Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustines</hi> foretreſſe beene pregnable, and not inuincible, as they made it, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would neyther Saint <hi>Paule</hi> in all <hi>the Churches of God,</hi> nor Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in <hi>the whole Church throughout the world,</hi> haue put more confidence, then in any one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church of ſome ſpeciall place. Or, let any man giue me a reaſon, why they did ſticke to ſay as much of euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church which they did ſee then to be in the right way, but only becauſe that although ſuch a particular Church were then in the right way, no leſſe then the whole Church: yet did they knowe, that the particular Church might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtray out of the way, but the whole Church might neuer goe aſtray.</p>
               <p>Thirdlie, let him conſider, that no
<pb facs="tcp:7013:63"/> Aduerſarie of ours is able well to charge the Church, ſith <hi>Saint Augustines</hi> time with any alteration made all this while: but we will ſhew, that the ſame preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed alteration was not an alteration, but euen ſo obſerued in that time alſo that ranne or paſſed betweene <hi>Saint Paul</hi> and S. <hi>Augustine.</hi> As preſently you heard him ſpeake of Exorcization and Exuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flation of children in Baptiſme: and<note n="*" place="margin">In the 5. motiue</note> before I alleaged out of him a practiſe likewiſe of his owne time, &amp; of a Prieſt of his owne, that <hi>offered</hi> (as we doe in the Maſſe) <hi>the ſacrifice of Chriſts bodie</hi> in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine forme, to deliuer it from the vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vvicked ſpirites.<note n="*" place="margin">In the 7. motiue</note> In another place I ſhewed, that his mother worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Bleſſed Sacrament of the Aultar with Religion euery day, as verie God &amp; Chriſt himſelfe: deſiring at her death, to haue it offered to God for her ſoule, &amp; for her ſins, which he alſo then cauſed to be done, and long after in writing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired all Prieſtes to doe for her the like.</p>

And if they neuer learne by experience eyther of their owne, or of others, and neuer ſee

               <p>Then touching the practiſe of other thinges alſo, as going a pilgrimage to Holy places, worſhipping of Relickes, praying to Saints, praying for the dead: it is ſo plaine by all the writers of thoſe times, that they were then no leſſe vſed, then now they be, that no thing there is which can more copiouſly be ſhewed, as all that read Antiquity know right wel. My purpoſed breuitie (as I haue often ſayed) ſuffereth not the allegatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny teſtimonies: but one ſhort ſaying wil I aleadge of S. <hi>Augustines,</hi> which in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few wordes doth manifeſtly witneſſe vnto vs the practiſe of all thoſe foure thinges at once vvhich I haue named.<note place="margin">De cur. pro mort. in fine.</note> Thus he ſayeth: <hi>Quod vero quiſquam apud

               <p>Here haue you expreſſie Relickes of Martyrs: for ſo he meaneth by <hi>a memory,</hi> as if you doubt, you may gather out of another place, where he ſaith:<note place="margin">De Ciui. Dei li <hi>22.</hi> cap. <hi>8.</hi>

You haue alſo here pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Martyrs, praying for the dead, &amp; Pilgrimage to Relickes, ſo liuely, that you ſee the practiſe thereof was (as I may ſay) infinite, people not being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent only in their life time to vſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, but alſo after their death to make ſuch Pilgrimage once for euer, there to reſt both their owne bodies, and their friends with the holy Relickes
<pb facs="tcp:7013:65"/> vntill the vvorldes end.</p>
               <p>In ſo much that bold I am to ſay, and proue it well I can, that whereas Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian people of thoſe firſt ages are coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as they were indeed, far more God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and more holy, and more deuout then wee, for no other cauſe it was, but onely becauſe they practiſed the things afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named and ſuch like, much more often, more religiouſlie, and (as the Heretikes would haue it falſly called and counted) much more ſuperſtitiouſly, then we doe: more going a Pilgrimage, more kiſsing of Relikes &amp; kneeling vnto them, more crying out to Saints, and all other ſuch thinges much more in thoſe dayes, then in theſe: &amp; therfore (I ſay) people then more deuout and religious, then now. Such going then a pilgrimage to Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, that S. <hi>Hierome</hi> ſayeth of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie places of our Sauiours Natiuitie, Croſſe, Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion: <hi>ad quae de toto orbe concurritur,</hi>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7013:65"/> friends, and vſed to hang in their cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to ſaue them from euill: yea ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenced, that they would not keepe it in their chambers, but build Churches to lay it in, for people at it to ſerue God, to come to it a Pilgrimage, and that with following of great Miracles:<note place="margin">De Ciui.

                  </note> all which S. <hi>Augustine</hi> writeth of his owne time, being himſelfe a partie therein. Such going a Pilgrimage to Rome like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, &amp; at Rome,<note place="margin">In Ezech. <hi>40.</hi>
                  </note> that S. <hi>Hierome</hi> writeth againe: <hi>Solebam puer Romae cum caeteris eiuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem aetatis &amp; propoſiti diebus Dominicis Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chra Apoſtolorum &amp; Martyru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> circuire, crebro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Cryptas ingredi, &amp;c.</hi> My vſe was being a boy, at Rome with others of the ſame age and meaning, vpon Sondaies to goe about the Apoſtles and Martyrs Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, &amp; often to enter into the Cryptes, &amp;c.

               <p>Finally all Antiquity is full of ſuch practiſe: bearing plaine witneſſe to the practiſe of the other pointes alſo of our Religion, as might eaſily be ſhewed, if breuity did permit, or if theſe foreſaied
<pb facs="tcp:7013:66"/> were not ſufficient. And yet as I proued before out of S. <hi>Augustine</hi> and S. <hi>Paule,</hi> for finding and knowing of the Truth, ſufficeth the practiſe alone of the church that now is. And diligentlie is it to be noted, that ſo plaine and vndoubted a thing is the Churches Practiſe, that the olde Heretikes neuer ventured for to chaunge it: as the Arrians, the Neſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Pelagians, &amp;c. But all their Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies conſiſted only in ſome matter of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous iudgement &amp; falſe opinion: but the face of religion they neuer changed.</p>
               <p>Wherby who ſeeth not, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, who are conuinced ſo plainely by the practiſe of the Church, both that now is, and that euer was, &amp; who haue chaunged the whole practiſe, the whole forme &amp; face of religion, are of all other Heretikes moſt groſſe and palpable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the whole vſe of the Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in all points, whereas onely to call in queſtion but any one point, is (as you haue heard S. <hi>Augustine</hi> ſay) the point of a moſt ſtraunge kind of very madneſſe? And wil they not yet ſee, acknowledge, confeſſe, and repent their fault, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne

But it needeth not, they confeſſe aſmuch them-ſelues. For els, why ſuffered they one Lewis Euans of late yeares to ſet out a naughty boke, wherein amongeſt many others his blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies and abhominations, hee called one of thoſe foure Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cells, that ſame of Chalcedon, a blaſphemous, proude, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious, Antichriſtian Councel, with many moe wordes of like detraction.</p>

As againſt praying for the dead, what Proteſtant
<pb facs="tcp:7013:77"/> hath beene heard to alleage <hi>Aerius,</hi> that was moſt certainely and moſt plainelie of that opinion? And who yet hath not heard them againſt the ſame alleage S. <hi>Augustine,</hi>

                  </note> that for the ſame opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt condemned Heretikes hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Aerius?</hi> Neyther alleage they euer <hi>Vigilantius, Iouinianus, Eunomius, Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> and other old Heretikes, for thoſe ſeuerall opinions, that they before theſe euidently did hold: but they alleage S. <hi>Hierome, Saint Epiphanius, Saint Baſile, Saint Irenee, Saint Clement,</hi> and our other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Fathers, for the very ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, which yet thoſe Fathers in thoſe Heretikes noted &amp; condemned as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies.</p>
               <p>Is it not by this manifeſt vnto all men that will not ſhut their eyes wilfullie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the light, that wee muſt beleeue the Fathers, that we muſt glory to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted their followers, their diſciples, their children? when as the very Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes themſelues, that beare falſe hearts towards them, dare not yet for feare of God, or ſhame of the world, but make faire countenance vnto them? Who
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7013:77"/> knoweth not, that <hi>Iewell</hi> in that famous chalenging ſermon of his made at <hi>Poules</hi> Croſſe, would ſeeme to make the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſo good groundes to build vpon, that if the Catholikes could out of them bring one ſentence, or halfe ſentence, word or halfe word, for many Articles in controuerſie there by him proponed that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he would ſubſcribe to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? So then it is touchyng the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers authority: But now on whoſe ſide they ſtand indeede, ours, or the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, although no wiſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or of meane experience in theſe matters, can be in doubt thereof: yet if need be, thus may it brieflie be ſhewed, that they be on our ſide, and that moſt certainely.</p>
               <p>Let any indifferent man conſider this with himſelfe, who they are, wee or the Proteſtants, that are faine to defend the Fathers, that are put to maintaine theyr credit, that are compelled to vpholde their authoritie. Plaine it is, that to this not the Proteſtants be driuen by vs, but that we therunto are driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by them. And therefore plaine it is, that the Fathers ſtand with vs, &amp; againſt the proteſtants.
<pb facs="tcp:7013:78"/> As if any man were ſo ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to doubt, on whoſe ſide ſtandeth the See Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, the Councell of Trent, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Machabees, Traditions of the Apoſtles, with many others that might be named: that the Proteſtantes raile at them, that we defend them: were not this a ſufficient and an euident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that they be on our ſide?</p>
               <p>So then, by the like doing of vs, both in the matter of the Fathers, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning them, wee defending them: it is moſt certainely declared, that they be on our ſide. As if at this time a man did doubt whether the ſaid Fathers be with the Proteſtants, or with the Puritans, would not his doubt very ſoone be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, if it were ſhewed vnto him, that the Proteſtants are driuen by the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans to defend the Fathers, calling them alſo Papiſts for their labour? Whereby againe it is manifeſt, that the Fathers are with the Catholikes, &amp; neither with the Puritans, nor with the Proteſtantes. And hereupon it was, that <hi>Iewell</hi> in his foreſaid chalenge did ſet a certaine nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Articles, as of the Maſſe, of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7013:78"/> Pope, of the Euchariſt, with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: leauing out purgatory, praying for the dead, praying to Saints, Merite of works, with a great number of many mo: becauſe (I ſay) in his very conſcience he did know as they doe all, if they read the Fathers, that they are ſo plainely on our ſide, that in moſt matters of controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie it can not with any colour be denied, or called in queſtion. For if in all pointes they be not with the Proteſtants (which by this you ſee they are not) then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly in all points be they with vs, becauſe there is not, nor neuer was, but one onely true Religion, not one then true, and now another true: but the ſame that then was true, the ſame novv true. Which (as I haue ſaid) cannot be the Proteſtants, becauſe of their plaine and in ſo many pointes confeſſed diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from the Fathers.</p>
               <p>Hereunto what can they ſay? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainelie nothing, but onelie this: that we are out of the way, and that the Fathers were out of the way, and that they only are in the way. By which their ſaying it is yet againe more plaine, that by their
<pb facs="tcp:7013:79"/> owne confeſsion they are not in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers way, which alſo out of their owne writinges might eaſily be ſhewed, that they ſticke not to ſay, the Fathers all to haue beene in error, but that it needeth not, being a thing otherwiſe well known to all ſuch as heare their Sermons, or be in place to heare them talke boldly and familiarly together amongſt themſelues, where they are not afraide plainely to confeſſe, that the Fathers all were Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes: as I haue already ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and vvill with the help of GOD, more largely proue hereafter, if it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, deſiring the Reader for this time to holde himſelfe content with this one freſh ſaying of Laurence Humphrey.<note place="margin">Libel. de vita Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.</note> ſpeaking of Iewels famous chalenging Sermon afore-mentioned, vvherein he prouoked the Catholikes to trie vvith him the mater by the Scriptures, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles, Fathers, and examples of the firſt ſixe hundred yeares of Chriſtes Church.

                  </gap>ſtrie? according to this example of S. <hi>Paule,</hi> I ſay, let it be firſt remembred, what Religion that was in which was planted in our Countrey at our firſt conuerſion vnto Chriſt by our Apoſtle Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> the Holie Monke that Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> ſent vnto vs about a thouſand yeares agoe, at which
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7013:92"/> tyme wee Engliſh-men were firſt made Chriſtians, being before alwayes, as other Paynims and Heathens, without hope or knowledge of Chriſt and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyon, giuen wholly to the ſeruing of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols.</p>
               <p>And to be ſhort, this matter may be ſoone knowen out of the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory of our owne Countryman Saint Bede, a man of great holynes and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, &amp; of great credit &amp; fame through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the vniuerſall Church of God both in his life and euer ſince his death, who lyued ſhortly after the time of our firſt Conuerſion, and vvrote the Hiſtorie of it in 5. bookes. a worke very worthy,<note place="margin">S. Bedes Storie.</note> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry expedient, very profitable, and verie neceſſarie to be read of all Engliſh-men that deſyre to haue vnderſtanding of things belonging much to their ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. There ſhall you finde it ſo plainlie, that the Religion then brougt in, vvas this very ſame that now the Proteſtants haue thruſt out, that no man either can, or (as I remember) doth denie it. For example, in the firſt Booke, Cap. 25. they came in with Croſſe, Image of Chriſt, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:7013:93"/> with Proceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, cap. 26. in Dover they v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſay Maſſe: with many other points of our Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that may there be found.</p>
               <p>Goe on then, &amp; conſider, how the ſaid Monke our Apoſtle with his fellovves perſwaded our Nation to that Religion. In the firſt boke, Cap. 26 you ſhall find, that the King was brought to beleue &amp; to be baptized, by their working of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Miracles: and namely in the ſecond Boke, cap. 2. how that hee chalenged the ſtubborne Britons (who being Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, yet diſſented from the reſt of the Church in peculiar practiſe of ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne pointes of Religion) to trie the truth betwene them, by reſtoring a blind man to his ſight, in ſuch maner as Elias vpon ſure confidence in God, chalenged the falſe prophets of Baal. The Britons could not doe it,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 28.</note> but <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> did perfourme it: as hee wrought alſo very many mo ſuch wonderfull Miracles, In ſomuch, that S. Gregorie in an Epiſtle that hee ſent him (which is to be ſeene, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>ca.</hi> 31.) thought good to admoniſh him of humilitie, knowing that S. Paul him-ſelfe had neede to haue giuen vnto
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7013:93"/> him an Angel of Satan to boxe and buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet him,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</note> leaſt that in the greatnes of hys Viſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s he might haue chaunced to take pride. Likewiſe, that he had the gift of Prophecie, and thereby foretold the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of thoſe Britons, which euen ſo came afterward to paſſe, you ſhal find in the ſecond Boke, &amp; ſecond Chapter.</p>
               <p>Al this now wel conſidered, whereas the Proteſtants, for that they ſee this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God to haue byn ſo euidently on our ſide, ſpeake much horrible Blaſphemie of him, not fearing God at al, who ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended him for his true ſeruant: let vs thinke that wee here him ſay vnto vs in hys ovvne commendation, compelled thereunto by theſe our corrupters, and his diſprayſers, as Saint Paul in the like caſe, and vpon the like neceſſitie ſaid of himſelfe vnto his Corinthians:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Si alijs no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſum Apoſtolus, tamen vobis ſum.

What wil we anſwere to this his ſaying, or what can we anſwere? Can wee denie his argument, but it is <hi>Saint Paules?</hi> It proued well, <hi>Saint Paul</hi> to haue binne an Apoſtle, whether thoſe falſe maſters of the Corinthians would, or no. It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth therefore, <hi>Saint Auguſtine</hi> likwiſe to haue byn an Apoſtle, a man ſent of God vnto vs, vvhether our falſe Preachers will, or no: vvhereunto (no doubt) they ſhal neuer be able to anſwere.</p>
               <p>Let vs then againe conſider, vvhat cauſes or reaſons haue carried vs awaie from his true Goſpell into the falſe goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of theſe men, what Miracles, what Viſions, what Scriptures, what Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, what Traditions, what Councels, vvhat Biſhopps of the See Apoſtolike, vvhat other ſuch thinges as afore I haue ſhevved to make for hys Goſpell. If

               <p>And therefore may our Apoſtle <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> ſay well vnto vs, as <hi>Saint Paul</hi> the Apoſte ſaid to his Galathians:<note place="margin">

For either are they proued inuincibly, to be of the Holy Ghoſtes endighting, or no Scripture at all is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be ſuch: as you may remember the common ſaying of S. Auguſtine,<note place="margin">Con. ep. fu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. ca. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note>

               <p>Seing then, that al this is ſo, I appeale me, &amp; ſo may any Catholike man bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with me, to the iudgement of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different man, and to the wiſedome of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that hath intelligence, whether it be not certayne, that the Proteſtantes pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſomuch of ſcripture proceedeth not of this that it beareth them at al any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde, but of that thing only which Saint Peter hath ſufficiently warned vs of, if at leaſt wiſe we wil take any warning, and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:7013:210"/> not wilfully impugne the truth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy our own ſoules. His warning is this: In the Epiſtles of our brother Paul:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Sunt quaedam difficilia intellectu, quae indocti &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabiles deprauant, ſicut &amp; caeteras Scripturas, ad ſuam ipſorum perditionem:</hi> There are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine things hard to be vnderſtod, which the vnlearned and vnſtable doe depraue &amp; wreſt (as they do alſo the other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to their very own perdition.</p>
               <p>So then the true cauſe, why theſe men be ſo buſie in wreaſting and writhing both of S.

<pb facs="tcp:7013:211"/> nor no where els euer to leaue their flit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnconſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie, but only by returning to the ſetled &amp; vnmoueable rock, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon both they before vvith vs, and wee ſtil yet thorough the only grace of God, doe ſtand vs ſteadfaſt. And once there ſtanding, they ſhal ſenſibly ſee, this to be moſt certaine that I ſay, no Scripture, no truth to be againſt the Catholykes, neither any at all to be for Heretiks.
